# Since this Django application is not using the Django REST Framework plugin, 
# you cannot use ViewSets, or ModelSerializers. 
# Even though you could use the Django ORM - since this is a Django project - you are going to practice your SQL skills again.

# Therefore, you are going to be writing plain Python functions that will receive the client request, query the database with SQL, and then use Django templates to send the fully constructed HTML template in response.
